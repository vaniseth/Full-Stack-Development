# NODE JS

Nodejs is a JavaScript Runtime. We create a server using Nodejs to host the website that we have created.

# NOSQL DATABASE

Normal structural databases have entities that we define. We have some entities like Salary, Age, Code but we don't know the name, in short we haev some info and not all the information. Here we use structured database and entities as a name-value pair. 

NoSQL database is used for unstructued data.
